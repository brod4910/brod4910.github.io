    I graduded in 2019 with my BS in Computer Engineering, emphasizing in both hardware and software. I was recognized as a campus-wide diversity scholar, achieved Dean's List Honors, and conducted machine-learning research 
    under two different research labs. I published two papers under Dr. Rajesh Menon where I collected data and conducted experiments using various deep learning algorithms. Publications can be found under the Projects and Publications tab.

    - Navigated complex stakeholder goals to create a real-time cloud-based computer vision pipeline that detected vehicle-type and color in low resolution cameras to aid local law enforcement with missing children cases
    - Collaborated closely with engineers, project managers, law enforcement, and Department of Transportation to continually adapt our detection system, ensuring its ongoing relevance and effectiveness
    - Implemented real-time segmentation algorithms that significantly reduced false positive detections and boosted true positive rates, enhancing the system’s reliability for accurate incident identification
    - Designed and deployed novel algorithms that detected stopped vehicles, crashes, debris, and fires to notify law enforcement and increase positive incident acquisition
