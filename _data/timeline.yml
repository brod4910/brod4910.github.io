    I graduded in 2019 with my BS in Computer Engineering, emphasizing in both hardware and software. I was recognized as a campus-wide diversity scholar, achieved Dean's List Honors, and conducted machine-learning research 
    under two different research labs. I published two papers under Dr. Rajesh Menon where I collected data and conducted experiments using various deep learning algorithms. Publications can be found under the Projects and Publications tab.
               
- title: Machine Learning Engineer, Banjo Inc., Park City, UT, US
  from: 2019
  to: 2020
  description: |
    At Banjo Inc., I developed a real-time cloud-based computer vision pipeline that identified vehicle types and colors in low-resolution traffic cameras, directly aiding law enforcement in missing child cases. 
    I collaborated closely with engineers, project managers, and government agencies to refine detection capabilities, ensuring the system remained effective and adaptive. 
    To improve accuracy, I implemented advanced segmentation algorithms that significantly reduced false positives while enhancing true positive incident identification. 
    Additionally, I designed and deployed real-time detection models for stopped vehicles, crashes, debris, and fires, increasing emergency response efficiency.

  from: 2020
  to: 2023
  description: |
    At MiiM Inc., I spearheaded the development of an edge computing object detection pipeline that transformed 3D spaces into top-down 2D projections, enabling precise pedestrian movement tracking. 
    I designed a custom people detection model optimized to run within 45 milliseconds, leveraging cutting-edge object detection techniques and hardware-specific optimizations to meet stringent real-time performance constraints. 
    To ensure efficient deployment, I developed a comprehensive edge computing library, integrating model timing, performance metrics, and image transformations, achieving consistent 15 FPS with 66 ms processing time on resource-limited devices.

  to: Present
  description: |
    Currently, I lead the design, implementation, and deployment of modular machine learning training and evaluation infrastructure, facilitating rapid model development across diverse vision domains. 
    My role extends beyond engineering as I engage directly with clients, adapting models to align with unique natural produce characteristics. 
    To streamline annotation efforts, I developed an unsupervised labeling system utilizing feature embedding clustering, reducing labeling time by 25% while providing early insights into model complexity for new produce requirements.
