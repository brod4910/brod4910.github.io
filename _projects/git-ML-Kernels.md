description: A small library where I implement and optimize common machine learning kernels

`ml-kernels`, is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from the ground up, focusing on iterative optimization and understanding of core concepts. Mainly focusing on implementing in plain CUDA, however, I tend to use a plain CPU implementation as a reference. Depending on the algorithm, I may also implement it using AVX.
