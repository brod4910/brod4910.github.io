# Tiny MLIR
In a best effort to learn about modern ML compiler tech stacks, I dove into tinygrad. Tinygrad is a tiny ML compiler with support for multiple
hardware targets and it quite simple to hack. MLIR on the otherhand is a rather complex beast to grabble with and has alluded me for quite sometime.
I ran through many tutorials but MLIR didn't seem to click with me quite like tinygrad did. Thus, out of frustration, passion, and drive, I thought to 
recreate tinygrad in MLIR.

# Motivation
My motivation for this project is as simple as wanting to learn MLIR and acquire a deeper understanding for optimizing an ML complier.

Another motivation is hopefully through this project, I can create an extensive tutorial on creating a real project using MLIR. I find that the MLIR ecosystem is lacking in this area hence my frustration and the origin of this project.

# Development

This project is still under active and heavy development. I try to work on this project everyday at the time of writing this (July 6 2024). That can change in the future but I'm pretty driven by getting this project working and running. Potentially even achieving some of the same performance metrics as the original tinygrad repo.
